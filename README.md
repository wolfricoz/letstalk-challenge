# Let's Talk Coding Challenge

## Overview
I have to create a website with a authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out. The users who can log in should be in the IP address table. The website should allow users to convert currency from one to another.

The goal is to do this in less than 8 hours, and with the bonus objectives my goal is 16 hours.
